So a single character that's within the access key is sufficient to bypass this control.\n\n### Example:\nThis is the snippet of code that does the comparison to authorize requests.\n\n```\nif (access_key && config.master.api.access_key.indexOf(access_key) !== -1) {\n```\n\nFor an access_key that is set to anything that includes the letter 'a' the following request would be authorized.\n\n```\n$ curl -X POST \"http://localhost:8081/api/exec\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d @test -H \"access-key: a\"\n{\n \"cmd\": \"ls\",\n \"path\": \".\",\n \"stdout\": \"app.js\\nconfig.js\\nlog\\nnode_modules\\nserver.js\\n\",\n \"stderr\": \"\"\n}\n```\n\n### Mitigating factors:\n\nThe admin interface is disabled by default. The module author confirmed that the access_key should really be an array of access_keys, however based on variable name and documentation it was not clear that it should be an array. The vulnerability exists only if a string access_key is set.\n\nModule version 0.0.6 has been updated to ensure an array of keys is provided as well as documentation updates.","recommendation":null,"references":null,"public":false},{"id":16,"created_at":"2015-10-03T19:03:06.128+00:00","updated_at":"2015-10-03T19:03:06.128+00:00","title":"CSRF Vulnerability in jquery-ujs","author":"Ben Toews of GitHub","module_name":"jquery-ujs","publish_date":"2015-06-24T09:00:00+00:00","cves":["CVE-2015-1840"],"vulnerable_versions":"<= 1.0.3","patched_versions":">= 1.0.4","slug":"jquery_ujs_csrf","overview":"This description pulled from the rubyonrails-security post.\n\nReported to NodeSecurity Project by Reed Loden.\n\nCSRF Vulnerability in jquery-ujs and jquery-rails\n\nThere is an vulnerability in jquery-ujs and jquery-rails that can be used to\nbypass CSP protections and allows attackers to send CSRF tokens to attacker domains.\n\nIn the scenario where an attacker might be able to control the href attribute of an anchor tag or\nthe action attribute of a form tag that will trigger a POST action, the attacker can set the\nhref or action to \" https://attacker.com\" (note the leading space) that will be passed to JQuery,\nwho will see this as a same origin request, and send the user's CSRF token to the attacker domain.","recommendation":"Upgrade to the latest version","references":"- hackerone.com: https://hackerone.com/reports/49935\n- npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery-ujs\n- rubyonrails-security: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/rubyonrails-security/XIZPbobuwaY/fqnzzpuOlA4J\n- github: https://github.com/rails/jquery-ujs","public":false},{"id":32,"created_at":"2015-10-03T19:03:06.128+00:00","updated_at":"2015-10-03T19:03:06.128+00:00","title":"semver Regular Expression Denial of Service","author":"Adam Baldwin","module_name":"semver","publish_date":"2015-04-04T02:00:00+00:00","cves":[],"vulnerable_versions":"<4.3.2","patched_versions":">=4.3.2","slug":"semver_redos","overview":"semver is vulnerable to regular expression denial of service ([ReDoS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS)) when extremely long version strings are parsed.\n\n\"The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a Denial of Service attack, that exploits the fact that most Regular Expression implementations may reach extreme situations that cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size).
